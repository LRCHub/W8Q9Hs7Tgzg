Is it true that you want it Said you won't let it
happen We agreed when it ended Said we won't need a lesson
And we know how it goes
If we only do it one more time
It's not a game
Things gonna change
So we should better hold and never cross that line
But now we're going back home Even though we won't say
so And I don't wanna say no Cause I don't wanna let go
I wanted wanted something And you want
it want it back Yeah you said you want it
I wanted wanted something And I
guess they were right Now I want you back
I wanted wanted something And you want
it want it back Yeah you said you wanted
I wanted wanted something And I
guess they were right Now you want me back
And we don't know what we started Don't know how we could end it
It's a really bad idea
But we still let it happen
And if we gonna lie
We can always do it one more time
Yeah kids gotta play
And I can explain
Yeah maybe that way we don't have to say goodbye
And now we're going back home Even
though we won't say so And I don't wanna say no
Cause I don't wanna let go
I wanted wanted something And you want it want it back

I wanted wanted something And you want
it want it back Yeah you said you wanted
I wanted wanted something And I
guess they were right Now you want me back
Eh
